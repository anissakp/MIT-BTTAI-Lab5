Lab 5: ML Life Cycle: Evaluation and Deployment

In this lab, you will continue practicing the evaluation phase of the machine learning life cycle. You will perform model selection for logistic regression to solve a classification problem. You will complete the following tasks:

1. Build your DataFrame and define your ML problem:
   - Load the Airbnb "listings" data set
   - Define the label - what are you predicting?
   - Identify the features
3. Create labeled examples from the data set
4. Split the data into training and test data sets
5. Train, test and evaluate a logistic regression (LR) model using the scikit-learn default value for hyperparameter C
6. Perform a grid search to identify the optimal value of C for a logistic regression model
7. Train, test and evaluate a logisitic regression model using the optimal value of C
8. Plot a precision-recall curve for both models
9. Plot the ROC and compute the AUC for both models
10. Perform feature selection
11. Make your model persistent for future use
